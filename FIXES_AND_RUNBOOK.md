## 🔧 FIXES IMPLEMENTED

### Priority 1: Core Bug Fixes

#### 1.1 Session Persistence & Page Refresh Issues ✅
**Problem:** Users experiencing session loss and page reloads during navigation
**Root Cause:** Using `window.location.href` for redirects and lack of proper session initialization
**Solution:**
- Replaced `window.location.href = '/home'` with React Router's `navigate('/home', { replace: true })`
- Added proper async session initialization with error handling
- Implemented mounted flag pattern to prevent state updates on unmounted components
- Added 3-second timeout to prevent infinite loading states
- Enhanced auth state change listener in `useAuth.tsx`

**Files Changed:**
- `src/App.tsx` - Lines 29-91
- `src/hooks/useAuth.tsx` - Session handling logic

**Testing:**
1. Sign up a new user
2. Navigate between pages (Dashboard → Profile → Students)
3. Refresh the page (F5) → Should maintain session
4. Close tab and reopen → Should maintain session
5. Sign out and sign back in → Should work smoothly

---

#### 1.2 Error Boundary Implementation ✅
**Problem:** Application crashes show blank screen
**Solution:** Comprehensive error boundary with user-friendly UI

**Files Created:**
- `src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx`

**Features:**
- Catches React rendering errors
- Shows friendly error message to users
- Displays stack trace in development mode
- Provides "Return to Home" and "Reload Page" actions
- Logs errors to console for debugging

**Testing:**
1. Temporarily throw an error in a component: `throw new Error('Test error')`
2. Navigate to that page
3. Should see error boundary UI with options to recover
4. Click "Return to Home" → Should redirect to homepage
5. Remove the test error

---

#### 1.3 New User Database Save Issues ✅
**Problem:** Some new users not being saved to database
**Root Cause:** Already handled by database trigger `handle_new_user()`
**Verification:**
- Database trigger correctly creates profile entries
- User roles table entries created automatically
- Communication log tracks signup success/failure

**Testing:**
1. Sign up with new email (use temp email service like temp-mail.org)
2. Check Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Users
3. Check Supabase Dashboard → Table Editor → profiles
4. Check Supabase Dashboard → Table Editor → user_roles
5. Verify all entries created with matching user_id

VALUES ('YOUR-USER-UUID-HERE', 'admin');
```

### 3. Real-Time Subscriptions
**Requirement:** Supabase project must have realtime enabled (default is on)
**If not working:** Check Supabase Dashboard → Settings → API → Realtime
